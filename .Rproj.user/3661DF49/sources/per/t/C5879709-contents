## MS Genotyping Pipeline

This is an effort to parse microsatellite trace files in fsa format together with epidemiological data to create data that can be uploaded at Online Program SpadeR https://chao.shinyapps.io/SpadeR/.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Setup

```{r setup}
list.of.packages <- c("Fragman","pacman")
new.packages <- list.of.packages[!(list.of.packages %in% installed.packages()[,"Package"])]
if(length(new.packages)) install.packages(new.packages)
```

## Use Package Fragman

The core of the package Fragman and the workflow of the fragment analysis rely in 4 functions:
1) storing.inds (function in charge of reading the FSA or txt(CQS) files and storing them with a list structure)

```{r sorting_inds}
# Loads package Fragman ========================================================
library('Fragman')

# Use of package Fragman =======================================================
# The core of the package Fragman and the workflow of the fragment analysis rely in 4 functions:
# 1) storing.inds (function in charge of reading the FSA or txt(CQS) files and storing them with a list structure)
fsa_dir <- "~/GitHub/peakscan/fsa"
fsa_data <- storing.inds(fsa_dir)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
