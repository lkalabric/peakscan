We did not find a good ladder in 37 sample(s). 
If you wish to correct it you can try one of the following:
"
"1","
a) The value of ladd.init.thresh might be too low, making noisy peaks too be abundant 
     Solution-- make sure your initial value 'init.thresh' is not below 200 RFUs
b) You can continue your analysis without worrying for those samples or removing. Identify them as:
     corro <- unlist(lapply(list.data.covarrubias, function(x){x$corr}))
     (bad <- which(corro < .9999))
c) MOST IMPORTANT! you can correct manually the bad samples using the 'ladder.corrector()' function providing the names of the bad samples (below), your ladder, and the information from the 'storing.inds' function, type ?ladder.corrector

Names of the bad sample(s):
