Peak scan analysis for microsatellite allelic discrimination and scoring

# Algorithm by Walter Blank
Pseudocode:
1) Read fsa binary files 
2) Check if fsa files follow the old or new format
3) Retrieves metada in a table
4) Report plot of all fsa files
5) Create overall plots of all channels (dyes)
6) Associate dye names with the channel
7) 


and extract its information into text files (useFragman.R)
2) Identify each peak from each marker (allele calling)
3)
